# Final Project

As my final project I decided to combine my two current hyper fixations: building websites and crafts (in my case ceramics)

This website helps hobby artists share their work and reach potential buyers by showcasing their hand crafted items in an online gallery with an interest-based system. Instead of public transactions, users can express interest and connect directly with the artist to complete purchases privately. The platform offers an alternative, more personal space for all hobby artists out their to show and sell their work.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
